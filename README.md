# About
This project is a Python game developed using the Turtle graphics library. The goal of this game is to help a turtle to cross the street.

# Game instructions
Use the arrow up key to move the turtle to the other side of the street without getting hit by a car. Be careful as the cars will be moving faster, each time you level up.
